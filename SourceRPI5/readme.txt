The template folder contains everything required to make a new ROOter build image for a brand new build system. As part of this change, everything needed for a new image is moved to a variable at the start of the setup script and autobuild19.conf files, with notes explaining where to change.

To set up a new system, copy the template directory and rename, change the noted minimum variables in the two scripts, and build the image.
