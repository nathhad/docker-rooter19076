###### ROOter Builder 19.07.6 (Docker)

This is a containerized build environment for ROOter GoldenOrb based on
OpenWRT release 19.07.6. At the time of this writing, this is the
primary build environment for ROOter, and covers 125 router models.

This container also includes the [nathhad/autobuilder](https://github.com/nathhad/autobuilder)
wrapper script system. It is meant to be a main building block to
construct and deploy ROOter autobuild servers, but also provides
full support for building custom images, including all of the usual
custom image abilities supported by the ROOter build environment.
